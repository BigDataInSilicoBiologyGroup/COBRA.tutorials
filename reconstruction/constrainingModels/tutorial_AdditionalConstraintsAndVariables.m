%% INTRODUCTION
% The COBRA Toolbox offers the possibility to add additional constraints to 
% a model, that are not direct flux constraints. One example is already indicated 
% in the constraining Models tutorial (constraining a sum of fluxes above a certain 
% bound), but there are plenty of other possibilities, that can be achieved using 
% constraints.
% 
% The tools introduced in this tutorial are mainly aimed at developers who 
% want to implement complex algorithms or formalisms within the COBRA Toolbox 
% environment, but the basics are also useful to integrate specific properties 
% of a model or specific literature data. The section "The COBRA Model structure" 
% is aimed at developers and can be skipped by users who don't to go into the 
% details.
% 
% 
%% The COBRA Model structure
% In general, the COBRA toolbox represents a model in a struct, using multiple 
% fields to represent the different properties of the model. Of particular interest 
% for analysis are the stoichiometric Matrix S (which represents the metabolic 
% stoichiometries of the reactions in the model). nder normal circumstances, this 
% matrix can directly be translated into the linear problem matrix A of a Problem 
% struct as used by the Toolbox. However, since there are several algorithms which 
% aim at manipulating reactions or metabolites, it is important to draw a distinction 
% between the stoichiometric matrix S and any other constraints or variables which 
% can be added to the model.
% 
% Therefore 3 additional matricies exist, where such information can be stored:
% 
% E - The matrix indicating the influence of additional variables on metabolite 
% levels.
% 
% C - The matrix of additional constraints on the reactions, which are not 
% derived from the steady state condition and
% 
% D - The matrix of interactions between additional Constraints and additional 
% variables.
% 
% Overall A COBRA model will be translated into a Linear problem by combining 
% these matrices in the following way:

% 
% The Cobra toolbox allows one sided inequality constraints and equality 
% constraints on a model. i.e. there is currently no mechanism to add a constraint 
% like:
% 
% $$c_{low} \le v_{R1} \le c_{high}$$
% 
% directly. Instead it would be necessary to add the two constraints:
% 
% $$c_{low} \le v_{R1}$$
% 
% and
% 
% $$ v_{R1} \le c_{high}$$
% 
% which is commonly what solvers will translate these constraints into anyways. 
% 
% It is best practice to not manually alter the sizes of these matrices, 
% but to use the functions appropriate model manipulation functions (addReaction/addMultipleReactions, 
% addMetabolite/addMultipleMetabolites, addCOBRAVariables, addCOBRAConstraints). 
% These functions will ensure, that the model structure stays in sync, and all 
% necessary fields are updated appropriately. There is a convenience function 
% to create the corresponding LPproblem struct to the given model: buildLPproblemFromModel(). 
% This function will create and initialize all necessary fields and builds the 
% corresponding LP problem. Any additional modifications of the LP problem imposed 
% by an algorithm should be done on this LP and not on the original model structure.
% 
% 
% 
% 
%% PROCEDURE
% Initially you will load a model for which we want to add a few additional 
% constraints. The model used will be the simple ecoli core model:

initCobraToolbox
model = getDistributedModel('ecoli_core_model.mat');
%Create a copy for comparisons
model_orig = model;
%% 
% We will add a restriction on the activity of the two aconitase proteins 
% present in ecoli (aconA and aconB), which catalyse two steps in the Citric acid 
% cycle (see below)
% 
% 
% 
%  From UNIPROT[1], the Km value of aconitase acting on citrate is 6.13 and 
% 23.8 umol/min/mg for aconA and aconB respectively. For cis-aconitate the values 
% are 14.5 and 39.1 umol/min/mg, respectively.

aconACit = 6.13;
aconAAcon = 14.5;
aconBCit = 23.8;
aconBAcon = 39.1;
%% 
% Now, there are two genes which code for aconitase in the ecoli core model: 
% b0118 (aconB) and b1276 (aconA). Both the Citrate hydratase and the aconitatde 
% dehydratase have the same GPR rule: (b0118 or b1276), so they can both use this 
% enzyme. 

aconAgene = 'b1276';
aconBgene = 'b0118';
%% 
% We would like to add a constraint, that not only restricts the activity 
% of these two reactions but also ensures, that the turnover rates are considered. 
% Lets assume, that we are looking at 1 minute time steps in our simulation. that 
% means, that one mg of aconA can suppoert a flux of 6.13 umol/min through the 
% reaction ACONTa:

printRxnFormula(model,'rxnAbbrList',{'ACONTa'},'gprFlag', true);
%% 
% OR a flux of 14.5 umol/min through ACONTb.

printRxnFormula(model,'rxnAbbrList',{'ACONTb'},'gprFlag', true);
%% 
% However, it will not be able to do both at the same time. Therefore, we 
% can assume, that in addition to its normal metabolites, the reaction also consumes 
% some of the enzyme (for this time step). However, both reactions can also be 
% catalysed by aconB, so they might actually not consume any of aconA. Therefore, 
% we need additional Constraints, that represents the activity through these two 
% reactions. And we need additional variables that represent the efficiency of 
% one mg of protein to catalyse the reactions.
% 
% Essentially, we have to encode:
% 
% A: The availability of the given proteins 
% 
% B: The efficiency of a protein to catalyse a specific reaction
% 
% C: The usage of that protein by the respective reaction.
% 
% And we will do so in this tutorial
%% Adding availability Variables.
% The rxns field is intended to only represent reactions from the model, so 
% if an additional variable is required for a specific task, this variable should 
% not be generated in the rxns field, but in a distinct field for this kind of 
% variables. So we will add availability variables, which can be thought of exchange 
% reaction for the enzymes. Lets assume, that we have a total of 0.02 mg of aconA 
% and a total of 0.01 mg of aconB (these numbers are completely arbitrary).

aconAAmount = 0.02;
aconBAmount = 0.01;
aconVars = {'aconA','aconB'};
model = addCOBRAVariables(model,aconVars,'lb',[0;0],'ub',[aconAAmount;aconBAmount]);
%% 
% 
%% Adding usage Efficiencies
% We further need a conversion between the used amount of aconA and the potential 
% flux through ACONTa. We also need this for ACONTb and the same for aconB.

linkedReactions = {'ACONTa','ACONTb'};
for enzyme = 1:numel(aconVars)
    for linkedReaction = 1:numel(linkedReactions)
        model = addCOBRAVariables(model,{strcat(aconVars{enzyme},'to',linkedReactions{linkedReaction})},'lb',0);
    end
end

%% 
% Now, we can add the respective constraints.
% 
% The first constraint is for the amount of aconA, which should be steady 
% (i.e. not more than made available by the aconA variable). More precisely, The 
% amount enzyme made available for ACONTa and ACONTb, should be balanced with 
% the amount of enzyme made available by the aconA variable.

model = addCOBRAConstraint(model,{'aconAtoACONTa','aconAtoACONTb','aconA'},0, 'c',[-1,-1,1],...
    'dsense','E', 'ConstraintID', 'aconAAmount');
%% 
% The same constraint is introduced for aconB

model = addCOBRAConstraint(model,{'aconBtoACONTa','aconBtoACONTb','aconB'},0, 'c',[-1,-1,1],...
    'dsense','E', 'ConstraintID', 'aconBAmount');
%% 
% Now, we also add the efficiencies:

model = addCOBRAConstraint(model,{'aconAtoACONTa','aconBtoACONTa','ACONTa'},0, 'c',[aconACit,aconBCit,-1],...
    'dsense','E', 'ConstraintID', 'ACONTaFlux');
model = addCOBRAConstraint(model,{'aconAtoACONTb','aconBtoACONTb','ACONTb'},0, 'c',[aconAAcon,aconBAcon,-1],...
    'dsense','E', 'ConstraintID', 'ACONTbFlux');
%% 
% Now, we have a a system, in which the two aconitase reactions are competing 
% for the available enzymes. 
%% Analysing the effects of the constraints
% If we compare the results of a simple FBA optimization of the original model, 
% and the constrained model:

orig_sol = optimizeCbModel(model_orig)
restricted_sol = optimizeCbModel(model)
%% 
% We can easily see, that the obtained objective of the modified model is 
% lower than that of the original model.
%% Modifiying Variables and Constraints
% Variables and constraints can be altered by the functions changeCOBRAVariable 
% and changeCOBRAConstraint respectively. Modifications on a variable include 
% the adjustment of upper and lower bounds (by the parameters lb/ub) as well as 
% the objective value (c) and the descriptive name (parameter 'Name').
% 
% Modifying constraints allows the adjustment of the coefficients (parameter 
% 'c') of the constraint as well as the directionality (parameter 'dsense') and 
% right hand side ( parameter 'd') of the constraint as well as the name (same 
% as for variables). There are several ways to update the coefficients: Either 
% a full row (including both values for the C and the E matrix (if any)) needs 
% to be provided, or the IDs along with the coefficients (similar to the situation 
% when generating the constraints) need to be provided. It is important to note, 
% that ALL coefficients will be reset, if a constraint is modified using the changeCOBRAConstraint 
% function.
% 
% An example of these functions is provided below:
% 
% If we increase the abundance of aconA (by increasing its upper bound)

model = changeCOBRAVariable(model,'aconA','ub',0.06);
less_restricted_sol = optimizeCbModel(model)
%% 
% We can see, that the objective increases as more flux through the TCA 
% is possible.
% 
% Similarily, if we reduce the efficiency of aconA on Citrate by 50%:

model = changeCOBRAConstraints(model,'ACONTaFlux','idList',{'aconAtoACONTa','aconBtoACONTa','ACONTa'},...
    'c',[aconACit*0.5,aconBCit,-1]);
less_efficient_aconA = optimizeCbModel(model)
%% 
% We can again see the objective drop.
% 
% While we only used a very simple example for this tutorial, this interplay 
% can improve predictive qualities substantially (for more have a look at e.g. 
% [2])
